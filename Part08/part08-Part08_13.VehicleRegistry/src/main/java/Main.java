  // Part01. Add equals and hashCode for the LicensePlate class
  // Part02. Add 3 methods:
  // public boolean add(LicensePlate licensePlate, String owner) assigns the owner it received as a parameter to a car that corresponds to the license plate received as a parameter. If the license plate doesn't have an owner, the method returns true. If the license already has an owner attached, the method returns false and does nothing.
  // public String get(LicensePlate licensePlate) returns the owner of the car corresponding to the license plate received as a parameter. If the car isn't in the registry, the method returns null.
  // public boolean remove(LicensePlate licensePlate) removes the license plate and attached data from the registry. The method returns true if removed successfully and false if the license plate wasn't in the registry.
  // Part03. Add 2 more method:
  // public void printLicensePlates()prints the license plates in the registry.
  // public void printOwners() prints the owners of the cars in the registry. Each name should only be printed once, even if a particular person owns more than one car.
